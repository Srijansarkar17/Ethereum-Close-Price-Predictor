# Ethereum-Close-Price-Predictor
This is a machine learning project where the close price of ethereum is predicted using machine learning.
## <--HOW WE BUILT THIS PROJECT-->
In this project we have used the linear regression algorithm and the accuracy of the model is around 99%
This is a full project and also consists of the frontend part using html and css.
The frontend part is not that good because we focused more on the machine learning part.
We connected the backend that is the machine learning part with the frontend using flask.
<--SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT-->
We can improve this project by focusing on the frontend part too making it more interactive.
